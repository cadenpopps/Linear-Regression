Caden Popps
Machine Learning Project 1


Required Libraries:
	pandas
	sklearn


Instructions:
	Part1.py showcases my learner, which can take iterations, learning rate, and starting weights as parameters. Syntax is as follows:

			python Part1.py [training_set.data] [test_set.data] [iterations] [learning_rate] [default_weight]

		With default values
			training_set = http://
			training_set = http://
			iterations = 100
			learning_rate = .001
			default_weight = 1

		All arguments are optional. Once complete, Part1.py outputs the results to log.txt


	Part2.py showcases the sklearn linear_model. This program can take the training set and test set as parameters as well. Syntax is as follows:

			python Part2.py [training_set.data] [test_set.data]

		Arguments are again optional. Once complete, Part2.py outputs the results to scikit_log.txt
